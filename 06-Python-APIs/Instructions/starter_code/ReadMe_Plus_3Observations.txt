Three observations fromt he city data in WeatherPy:

1. As the latitude goes toward +90 degrees and -90 degrees, the max temperature falls. The highest temperatures are found at latitude 0 degrees.

2. The correlation coefficients for humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed are very small, which means that latitude is not largely responsible for 
	changes in these variables.

3. Cloudiness values of 0 and 100 seem to be very common for northern latitude cities.
