I have uploaded all the files to the Starter_Code repository.

The link to access the website is at:

The repository consists of a main index website. The logic.js in the javascript folder creats the map.

The PB2002_boundaries.js stores the geoJSON data for the plate boundaries as a variable. However, the logic.js
file directly loads the data from a URL and does not use this file.

The map has three base layers to choose from:  street, topography, and satellite.

The map also has three overlay layers: Earthquake markers, Plate boundaries, and Thicker plate boundaries. The map displays 
all the overlay layers in the beginning even though none of the layers are orginally selected. However, if you toggle the layers
on and off, the different layers do disappear and reappear accordingly.
