This project is about creating a dashboard to display information about 
the belly buttons of different samples.

I placed all the required files in the "StarterCode" folder inside the 
"Starter_Code" folder inside the "14-belly-button-challenge" folder 
inside my bootcamp homework folder.

Inside this folder, I have the samples.json data file which isn't really 
necessary for this project. I also have a python_helper jupyter notebook
that I used to look at the json data. It is not necessary to display
the dashboard. The index.html file renders the dashboard.

The static folder include the app.js file that is the javascript that I
used to help the index.html file render the webpage.
